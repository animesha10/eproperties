Contact: Paul Bemowski, bemowski@yahoo.com

===============================================================================

1.1.1 
  - Fixed list(), not printing key on lists.

1.1.0 Released 14 Sep 2010
  - Bundled all unreleased changes from 1.0.8RCx.  There were some significant
    changes and additions.

1.0.8 Unreleased
  - Changed list() to list Lists with () rather than [].  This makes the 
    output of list() parsable back to properties. Which is important because
    toString() uses this.  The following should be true:
    given EProperties props: 
    EProperties p=new EProperties();
    p.load(props.toString()) == props
  - Changed merging logic on root includes to be 'deep merge'. This allows
    included override files to define individual "deep" keys with complex
    key puts.
  - Updated all of the scripts in bin to operate in a location independent way.
  - updated build.xml to make dist depend on clean.
  - Support for un-secure https
  - Support for basic authentication in URL, form http(s)://user:passwd@www.foo.com/
  - Unit tests for isSourceModified()
  - RC4
    - Properties entrySet() and enumeration fixes.

1.0.7 Released 30 July 2010
  - Added a System property to allow for disabling the properties caching
    mechanism. 
    - Requested by Miglena Rousseva.
  - More rigidly defined, executed and tested escaping rules.
    - See docs/EscapingRules.xls for details on designed function  
    - Design goal is to match behavior of java.util.Properties for simple 
      properties wherever possible. Series of unit tests confirm this.
  - Fixed critical bug in the EProperties.put() code when called from
    the parser.  Was using the full key string (including comments) as
    the property key - rather than the key itself.  Don't know how this
    one got by earlier testing.  Now covered by unit test.
  - Allow comment lines embedded in lists.  This is a parser update, but 
    seems to work in available test cases.
  - Support for classpath:/ style URLs.  This allows a file to include
    properties from a classapth - and supports relative inclusion, etc.
    
  - Added printing of version and project URL info on class loading.
  - Added PDiff/FileDiff
  - Added Hit counters on keys.  Useful in tracking what properties are used
    and what properties are not used.  

1.0.6 Released 27 May 2010
  - Changes from Fred Hart - 
    - changed parser to better support legacy characters
    - changed default delimiter character in the CacheManager to support Windows


1.0.5 Released 10 Feb 2010
  - Fixed bug in put with complex key, found by Randall Theobald 
  
1.0.4 Released 9 Feb 2010
  - Added put with complex keys, that works as you would expect after
    understanding complex keys.
  - Added flatten method with custom delimeter for Fred Hart.

1.0.3 Released Feb 6 2010
  - Fixed potential NPE in the toString() method.  toString is now over
    ridden, and returns the same value as the list() method.
  - Updates to Lists
    - Added a getList(String key, List<String>def) method - allowing the
      user to get lists with default values.
    - Added a function to convert a CSV String to a list when the
      getList() method is called, and the value is a String.
  - Updates to JavaDoc

1.0.2 Released 24 Nov 2009
  - Fixed CacheManager when EProperties.load(InputStream) was called.  It 
    was throwing an NPE.
  - Added unit testing stuff, including build time tests.
  - Added tests for loading properties via InputStream and zip/jar URL.

1.0.1 
  - Packaging for deployment


1.0.0    Unreleased.  
  - This version defines the starting point for the open source version 
    of extended properties.
  - This version is checked into SVN, but was never packaged for deployment.
