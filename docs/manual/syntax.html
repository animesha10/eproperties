<h1>Syntax</h1>

<p>This page describes the Syntax extensions supported by the EProperties
object.</p>

<p>The discussion of syntax extensions is divided into:</p>
<p> [ 
    <a href="#ebnf">EBNF</a> |
    <a href="#basic">Basics</a> |
    <a href="#nesting">Nesting</a> |
    <a href="#lists">Lists</a> |
    <a href="#substitution">Substitution</a> |
    <a href="#inclusion">Inclusion</a> ] 
</p>


<!-- ========================== EBNF ===================== -->
<h3><a name="ebnf">EBNF</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus-Naur_Form">
Extended Backus-Naur Form or EBNF</a> metasyntax used to represent the 
grammar or syntax of a language/file format.  
</p>

<pre>
eProperties = { <a href="#key">key</a> "=" <a href="#value">value</a> | <a href="#comment">comment</a> | "[" <a href="#root.include">includeURL</a> "]" };

<a href="#comment">comment</a> = "#" string EOL;
<a href="#key">key</a> = keyString;
value = [ <a href="#value">stringVal</a> | <a href="#lists">listVal</a> | "{" <a href="#nesting">eProperties</a> "}" | "[" <a href="#nested.include">includeURL</a> "]" ];

<a href="#lists">listVal</a> = "(" quotedString ["," quotedString] ")" ;
stringVal = quotedString | string EOL;
quotedString = '"' string { [EOL string] } '"';

string = ? all standard characters ?;
keyString = ? [a-z,A-Z,.,-,_,0-9] ?;
EOL = ? End of line character ?;
<a href="#include.urls">includeURL</a> = ? A relative or absolute include URL ?
</pre>

<p>One key feature of EProperties not represented in the EBNF, is the 
concept of <a href="#substitution">substitution</a>.  This is actually by 
design - because substitution is not processed at <b>parse</b> time, rather
subsitutions are processed when the value is requested from the 
EProperties object.</p>

<!-- ========================== BASIC ===================== -->
<h3><a name="basic">Basic</a></h3>

<p> [ <a href="#comment">Comments</a> | 
   <a href="#key">Keys</a> |
   <a href="#value">Values</a> ] </p>

<p>The most basic syntax of EProperties supports most of the same constructs
as the java.util.Properties object.  This includes key/value pairs, and 
comments. </p>

<pre>
<font color="red"># This is a comment</font>
key=value
</pre>

<p>Let's explore the core syntax elements - key / value / comment -  in a bit 
more detail...</p>

<h4><a name="comment">Comments</a></h4>
<p>Comments are define as any line in which the first non-whitespace character
is a '#' symbol.  This is the only definition of a comment in EProperties.</p>

<h4><a name="key">Keys</a></h4>

<p>Keys must be unique at any level within the EProperties tree.  If you use 
a key again, the second value will override the first value.  </p>

<p>For Example:</p>
<pre>
key=value
key=yippie
</pre>

<p>Results in the value represented by 'key' being 'yippie'.  The second use 
of the identical key results in the second value overridding the first value.</p>


<h4><a name="value">Values (String values)</a></h4>
<p>Values defined in EProperies are similar to values defined in 
java.util.Properties.  Values can be a simple string, or a quoted string. 
Quoted string values can contain quotes themselves, escaped with the 
backslash (\) character.  Quoted strings can also contain newlines - and
this is the primary / only mechanism within EProperties to define multi-line
String values.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre>
<font color="red"># A trivial key/value pair</font>
key=value

<font color="red"># A quoted string works too...</font>
qstring="This is a quoted String value"

<font color="red"># Value with embeded double quotes, escaped</font>
with.quotes="Upon discovering EProperties, he said \"Egad!\""

<font color="red"># This is a multi-line string value</font>
poem="Roses are red
Violets are blue
most poems rhyme
but this one doesn't."
</pre>

<!-- ========================== NESTING ===================== -->

<h3><a name="nesting">Nesting</a></h3>

<p>[ <a href="#complex.keys">Complex Keys</a> ] <p>

<p>The first true extension we will describe is the nesting of properties.
The nesting syntax allows you to 'embed' an EProperties object as 
the <code>Value</code> represented by a <code>Key</code>.  That may sound
confusing at first, so lets look at an example:</p>
<pre>
<font color="red"># This is a comment</font>
key=value

<font color="red"># Nesting syntax</font>
nested={
   bar=baz
}
</pre>

<p>In the example above, the root properties object has 2 keys.  The first 
key named <code>key</code> has a single String value, <code>value</code>.  But the second
key's value is not a String, it is again an EProperties object, with a single 
key-value pair.</p>

<p>So, in code, we may access this value like this:</p>
<pre>
EProperties root=new EProperties();
root.load(file);
EProperties nested=root.getProperties("nested");
System.out.println ("the value of bar in nested is "+nested.getString("bar"));
</pre>

<p>Results in:</p>
<div class="output">
the value of bar in nested is baz
</div>

<h4><a name="complex.keys">Complex Keys</a></h4>
<p>The above code is valid, and quite useful.  But in some instances it can become
a bit cumbersome.  At this point we will add the definition of a 
'complex key.'  A complex key and reference directly into a nested sub-properties
object, with a simple pointer style syntax.  As an illustration, the code 
below is equivalent, but a bit more concise using a complex key: </p>

<pre>
EProperties root=new EProperties();
root.load(file);
System.out.println ("the value of bar in nested is "+root.getString("<b>nested-&gt;bar</b>"));
</pre> 
<p>Also results in:</p>
<div class="output">
the value of bar in nested is baz
</div>

<p>In that example, <code><b>nested-&gt;bar</b></code> is a complex key.</p>

<p>With only a single layer of nesting depth, a complex key may not save 
too much effort.  However as you start to use deeper levels of nesting, 
<code>complex keys</code> become much more useful.  </p>

<p>In addition, <code>complex keys</code> are vital once we start describing
<a href="#substitution">substitutions.</a></p>

<!-- ========================== LISTS ===================== -->
<h3><a name="lists">Lists</a></h3>
<p>Like nesting, the List syntax extension is simply a way to put lists of 
Strings into an EProperties object.  Lists themselves can only be lists of 
Strings - not lists of nested properties objects.  Lists also support
<a href="#substitution">substitutions</a> of values, described later.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
<font color="red"># Here are 2 simple lists</font>
primary.colors=("red", "green", "blue")
pure.colors=("red", "yellow", "green", "blue")
</pre>

<p>Defines 2 simple lists.  Accessing the lists via the EProperties API is 
straightforward: </p>

<pre>
List&lt;String&gt; primaryColors=props.getList("primary.colors");
</pre>

<!-- ========================== SUBSTITUTION ===================== -->
<h3><a name="substitution">Substitution</a></h3>
<p> [ <a href="#resolving">Resolving Substitutions</a> | 
   <a href="#default.values">Default Values</a> |
   <a href="#complex.key.sub">Complex Keys</a> |
   <a href="#nested.keys">Nested Keys</a> |
   <a href="#partial.complete">Partial vs. Complete</a> ]
   </p>

<p>Substitution is a very powerful, but simple construct.  The substitution
syntax follows the syntax used in a number of other languages - such as
bash/unix variable substitution, and Ant build files.  The syntax uses 
a $ in front of {} to denote the variable substitution.</p>

<p>A simple example is again the easiest means of describing: </p>

<pre>
location="World!"
message="Hello <b>${location}</b>"
</pre>

<p>In this simple example, the value of the key 'message' would be "Hello World!"</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Substitution processing happens, and keys are resolved to 
values and replaced when the value is requested from the properties object, and
not before.  Substitution DOES NOT happen at parse time, but rather at runtime.</p>

<h4><a name="resolving">Resolving Substitution Values: the back-search algorithm</a></h4>

<p>When a substituion key is encountered, the value returned will be 
substituted with the value of the property requested inside of the {}.  The 
search for a value will start at the current level within the properties tree.
If a value is not found, EProperties will search backwards in the nesting
until it finds a value.</p>  

<p>If no value is found, then the string is not substituted and is returned
with the substitution text intact.  This is considered an error state - 
and may write an error to System.out.  </p>

<pre>
host="localhost"

case.A={
   message="The current host is ${host}"
}
case.B={
   host="127.0.0.1"
   message="The current host is ${host};
}
case.C={
   message="The current host is ${hooost}"
}
message="The host here is ${host}"
</pre>

<p>Running the above properties file through the EProperties parser, results
in the following (note the values for host, and how the resolution algorightm
worked):</p>

<div class="output">
15:19:43.252 WARNING 10:main EProperties Value for key 'message' 
defined in terms of un-resolvable substitution: 'The current host is ${hooost}'
---- listing ----
host=localhost
case.A= {
  message=The current host is localhost
}
case.B= {
  host=127.0.0.1
  message=The current host is 127.0.0.1
}
case.C= {
  message=The current host is ${hooost}
}
message=The host here is localhost
---- end listing ----
</div>

<h4><a name="default.values">Defining Default Values for Substitutions</a></h4>

<p>When EProperties cannot find a value for a substitution, an error 
occurs.  Very often this is the desired behavior - if a value is not 
defined, the substitution should fail - and alert us that we've cocked 
something up while writing the properties file.</p>

<p>However, sometimes, it might be nice to specify a default value for 
a substitution in the even that no suitable value can be found.  There
will be examples later where this is very desirable.  Default values 
are supported with a simple syntax.  Consider the following:</p>
<pre>
host="havana"

case.C={
   message="The current host is <b>${hooost|localhost}</b>"
}
</pre> 

<p>In this example, the key for substituion is 'hooost' and if no value
can be found for that key, the default value of 'localhost' is substituted.

It is important to note that the search algorithm will walk up the 
properties tree in search of a substitution value, and only use the default
if no value can be found after the resolution algorithm is completed unsuccessfully.</p>

<h4><a name="complex.key.sub">Complex Key Substitution</a></h4>

<p>Complex keys can be used for substitution values.  A complex key works 
exactly the same as a simple key with respect to substitution, including
the search algorithm and default values.</p>

<pre>
test.url="http://${dev->host}/foo.html"

dev={
   host=snoopy.jmatrix.net
}
prod={
   host=prod.jmatrix.net
}
</pre>

<p>In the above example, the value of test.url is 'http://snoopy.jmatrix.net/foo.html'.
Remember, the substitution happens AFTER the file is parsed.  Which means that
the value can be defined after the key is used as a substitution value.</p>

<h4><a name="nested.keys">Nested Key Substitution</a></h4>

<p>Nested key substitution deals with keys of the form: ${foo${bar}}.  
Complete explanation is TBD.</p>

<h4><a name="partial.complete">Partial vs. Complete Substitution</a></h4>

<p>An explanation here is TBD.  (substitution as nested properties).</p>


<!-- ========================== INCLUSION ===================== -->

<h3><a name="inclusion">Inclusion</a></h3>

<p>[ <a href="#nested.include">Nested Inclusion</a> | 
   <a href="#root.include">Root Inclusion</a> |
   <a href="#include.urls">Include URLs</a> |
   <a href="#include.options">Options</a> |
   <a href="#method.include">Method Inclusion</a> ]
</p>

<p>The inclusion feature of EProperties provides a syntax allowing one
file to include properties from another file/URL.  This can be very 
powerful when building complex configurations.
The inclusion mechanism supports a few URL syntaxes - including file://, 
http://, https://, and method:// which we will 
<a href="#method.include">cover in more detail later.</a></p>

<h4><a name="nested.include">Nested Inclusion</a></h4>

<p>Nested inclusion allows you to include a Properties file as a subkey
in the current properties file.  (To understand nested inclusion, you 
must understand <a href="#nesting">nesting properties</a> described 
earlier.) Consider this simple example:</p>

<p>app.properties:</p>
<pre>
app.name="My Test Application"
app.version="2.0"

db={
   host=test.jmatrix.net
   name=testapp
   user=spider
   pass=monkey
   driver=
   url=jdbc:mysql://${host}:3306/${testapp}
}
</pre>

<p>This can be split into 2 files, call them app.properties and db.properties, 
that will parse and resolve to the exact same resultant EProperties object.. </p>

<p>app.properties:</p>
<pre>
app.name="My Test Application"
app.version="2.0"

<b>db=[db.properties]</b>
</pre>

<p>db.properties:</p>
<pre>
host=test.jmatrix.net
name=testapp
user=spider
pass=monkey
driver=
url=jdbc:mysql://${host}:3306/${testapp}
</pre>

<p>Note that the included db.properties file is <i>included</i> in the 
app.properties file as nested properties object under the <code>db</code> key.</p>

<h4><a name="root.include">Root Inclusion</a></h4>

<p>Root inclusion is when the included properties file is included at the
same level into the current properties file.  If we changed app.properties 
in the above example to this:</p>
<pre>
app.name="My Test Application"
app.version="2.0"
<b>[db.properties]</b>
</pre>

<p>Then the db.properties would be included in the app.properties at the 
same level, rather than being nested under the sub-key <code>db</code>.</p>

<h4><a name="include.urls">Inclusion URLs</a></h4>

<p>There are several important rules to understand when including properties
files / URLs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Absolute urls begin with a protocol and are resolved as absolute urls. </li>
  <li>Relative URLs are loaded relative to the URL of the parent properties object.
     <ul>
	     <li>If the parent is <code>http://jmatrix.net/app.properties</code>, and you include 
	     <code>[db.properties]</code>, it is relative to its parent - or <code>[http://jmatrix.net/db.properties]</code></li>
	     <li>If the parent is a file, as in <code>config/app.properties</code> and you include 
	     <code>[db.properties]</code>, it is relative to its parent - or <code>[config/db.properties]</code></li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>If no protocol is specified, it is assumed to be a file.  The file path
  follows all of the rules associated with Files in Java.  Ie, if the path is
  relative, it is relative to System.getProperty("user.dir");</li>
  
  <li>Inclusion happens <b>at parse time</b>.</li>
  <li>If the EProperties inclusion processor cannot find the properties file
  at the requested URL, it is considered and error, and the parse will fail.
  This can be optionally disabled with <a href="#failonerror">failonerror=false</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="include.options">Inclusion Options</a></h4>

<p>The inclusion processor respects a couple of options that can be useful
to change the behavior of the inclusion processor.  Options are specified
after the inclusion url, and delimited with a pipe (|). </p>

<h5><a name="failonerror">failonerror=false</a></h5>
<p>This option tells the inclustion processor that if it cannot find a file, 
it should not cause an error.  This option can be useful when adding optional
local overrides to a file.  If there are no overrides - and the file does not
exist - then the inclusion processor will not fail.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
[/etc/local.properties|failonerror=false]
</pre>

<h5>parse=false</h5>
<p>This tells the inclusion processor to include the referenced file as
a string, rather than another properties file.  This ONLY works on Nested
includes.  <b>Substitutions are still
processed within this String value.</b></p>

<p>This option can be useful for including SQL commands/files as part of
a properties based configuration, while still processing substitutions 
within those SQL files.  There are surely additional uses.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
sql=[updateUser.sql|parse=false]
</pre>

<h4><a name="method.include">method:// Inclusion Syntax</a></h4>

<p>Method properties inclusion allows you to include properties that 
are available to the JVM via a static method call. This could be a static
method call to your custom code.  Perhaps more commonly, we can include the
java System properties in the current properties context.  Including system 
properties is especially useful, because we can use <a href="#substitution">
substitutions</a> based on the system properties.</p>

<p>To include Java System properties in the current context, nested under the
system key, we would use the following syntax:</p>
<pre>
<font color="red"># Load the java system properties</font>
system=[method://java.lang.System.getProperties()]
</pre>

<p>On systems that support it, we can also load the available environment
variables as nested or root properties.</p>
<pre>
<font color="red"># Load the Environment</font>
envvars=[method://java.lang.System.getenv()]
</pre>

<p>It is left to the user to extrapolate this to including properties
by calling static methods on other classes - including your own.</p>
