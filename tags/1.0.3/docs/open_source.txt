Need to get javacc running via Ivy.


- Simple design doc, class and sequence diagrams
  - class diagram showing EProperties extends Properties
- Architecture of parser, choice of Javacc

Documenting the solution may help my own understanding of what it is that I've done.


- Need to be really clear on this before opening up to the world, so we 
  can point to the mission statement when we say "no" to all the 
  crazy ideas that may come in - if anyone is actually listening.
  - Goals / non goals

  - "So people can't show up and derail the direction"
